# COOLFORM!

## What is COOLFORM!

Coolform! is a mini-project part of my learning journey as a Junior Full Stack Developer with Find My Past as part of the Arborists. In this mini-project I replicate one of the forms the user can fill up when creating a person in Find My Past website.
## First Stage

The first stage of the project involves using the front end technologies I have learnt during the first months and it includes the following:

- React
- Formik
- Jest

The first stage of Coolform! consists on creating the front end by using React and Formik to create an initial home page where the user can click on a button that leads to a new page with a form to create a new user. The form has some fields that are compulsory to complete and some that are optional. If the compulsory fields are touched and not completed or the save button is clicked without completing them, those fields shows a message indicating that before saving the field needs to be completed. Once all the fields are completed correctly, the form is printed in the console.

Units tests were also added to test the applications behavior is correct and to prevent it breaks in the future.
